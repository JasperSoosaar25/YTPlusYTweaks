# YTPlusYTweaks – Integrated Tweaks ;3

A lovingly stitched together chaos bundle of powerful YouTube tweaks :3  
Everything injected. Nothing spared.  

---

## 🎬 YouPIP
**Native Picture-in-Picture support**

- Enables real PiP inside the iOS YouTube app
- Adds a dedicated PiP button (if enabled)
- Works by dismissing the app while playing a video
- Requires `YTVideoOverlay` to function

Because background watching is a human right ;3

---

## 📺 YTUHD (4K / 2K Unlock)
**Unlocks 1440p & 2160p resolutions**

- Bypasses YouTube’s A/B restrictions
- Enables VP9 & AV1 where possible
- Spoofs minimum iOS requirements when needed
- Uses software decoding fallback on unsupported devices
- Supports sideloading (with some entitlement limitations)

Basically tells YouTube “yes my device *can* handle 4K, stop judging me” ;3

---

## ⚙️ YouQuality
**Instant video quality selector in overlay**

- View & change resolution directly from player overlay
- Works best with `YTClassicVideoQuality`
- Requires `YTVideoOverlay`

No more digging through 5 menus just to get 1080p :3

---

## 👎 Return YouTube Dislike
**Brings back dislike counts**

- Pulls data from the Return YouTube Dislike database
- Optionally submit your votes (disabled by default)
- Replaces the “Dislike” text with the real count

Because numbers matter and we miss them ;3

---

## 🧃 DontEatMyContent
**Prevents notch / Dynamic Island from eating 2:1 videos**

- Constrains rendering to safe area
- Only activates for ultra-wide videos
- Keeps your content fully visible

Dynamic Island does NOT get a bite today ;3

---

## 🧪 YTABConfig
**A/B experiment controller**

- Configure hidden YouTube feature flags
- Supports 16.29.4+
- Useful for enabling or disabling internal experiments

Mess with the experiments before they mess with you :3

---

## 🛠 YTweaks
**Extra QoL & feature unlocks**

Working:
- Lock fullscreen orientation
- Disable floating miniplayer
- Virtual fullscreen bezels
- Casting fixes (older versions)

Experimental:
- Hide AI summaries

Designed around YTLite / YouTube Plus builds ;3

---

## 🎨 YTIcons
**Lists & exposes YouTube YTIIcon icons**

- Useful for tweak developers
- Allows custom icon usage in settings

Because default icons are boring :3

---

## 🚫 Generico (Gonerino)
**Channel & content blocker**

- Block specific channels
- Block individual videos
- Block via keywords
- Removes unwanted suggestions
- Cleans home & search feeds

Curating your algorithm like a villain mastermind ;3

---

## 🗂 YouGroupSettings
**Groups all tweak settings into one section**

- Creates a dedicated “Tweaks” settings group
- Automatically organizes supported tweaks
- Custom icon support
- Works with grouped settings experiment

Keeps the chaos organized. We love structured chaos ;3
